# kuromi matrix !!
a ysws submission for [#neon](neon.hackclub.dev) written in circuitpython that displays results on the 64x32 rgb led matrix is compatible with the hack club neon editor for a featherwing m4 express board. <br>
<br>
my submission, that's sanrio/kuromi themed, displays the current date, local time & weather for new delhi, india (indian standard time = gmt +5:30) and calls from the openweathermap api
<br>
<br>
a preview of how the code appears on the neon editor can be found below: <br><br>
